Learning <b>OpenCV</b> can be tough when there are tons and tons of resources out there. This repo will help you learn the basics of Image Processing using <b>OpenCV Python</b>.
I have divided each section into multiple folders. Each python file has notes inside it which will be useful to understand the codes better.
Projects are included as well!
